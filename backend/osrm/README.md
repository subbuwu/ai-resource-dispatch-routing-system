# OSRM Map Data Directory

This directory contains OSRM routing data files. These files are **NOT** committed to git due to their large size.

## Required Files

To run the OSRM routing service, you need:

1. **Source Map File**: `map.osm.pbf` - OpenStreetMap data in PBF format
2. **Processed Files**: Various `.osrm.*` files generated by OSRM after processing the map

## Setup Instructions

1. Download or obtain an `.osm.pbf` file for your region
2. Place it in this directory as `map.osm.pbf`
3. Run OSRM extraction and contraction:
   ```bash
   osrm-extract map.osm.pbf
   osrm-contract map.osrm
   ```
4. This will generate all the necessary `.osrm.*` files

## File Sizes

- `.osm.pbf` files can range from 100MB to several GB depending on region
- Processed `.osrm.*` files are typically 2-3x the size of the source `.osm.pbf` file

## Note

All files in this directory are ignored by git (see `.gitignore`). Each developer/deployment needs to generate or download these files separately.
