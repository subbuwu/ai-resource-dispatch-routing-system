# Disaster Relief Routing Backend

This backend system computes the **safest and shortest route** for disaster relief vehicles by combining real road network routing with disaster-specific road condition data using only open-source technologies.

---

## Objective

To provide a backend service that:
- Computes routes using real road data
- Avoids damaged or blocked roads
- Separates routing computation from disaster intelligence
- Is fully open source and extensible

---

## Core Technologies

- **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** – Free road network data
- **OSRM** – High-performance routing engine
- **PostGIS** – Spatial database for disaster data
- **FastAPI** – Backend coordination layer
